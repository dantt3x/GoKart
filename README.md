# GoKart
A gokart framework I made, currently remaking into version 2.

Currently the project is very laggy because:
- too much load on the server
- too many things tied to framerate (leading to extreme velocities randomly).
- janky formulas.

Additionally, due to advice from my peers, the game needs to be restructed due to exploitability with the karts (oops!).

The project was very fun to make, there isn't a lot of go kart styled games on the market, especially on Roblox. Will be coming back soon!
